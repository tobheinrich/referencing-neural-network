# Referencing with a neural network

This python code implements a fitting procedure based on a small neural network to find the optimal reference in a transient absorption experiment. Here, the functional behaviour between a reference spectrum and the signal spectrum if learned by a three layer feedforeward neural network. It was developed for experiments with high harmonic generation sources but can be applied for various referencing tasks.

More detailes and the performance are described in T. Heinrich et al., "Suppression of high-harmonic source noise with machine learning". Please reference this paper if you use this code.
