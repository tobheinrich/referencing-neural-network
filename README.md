# Neural Network Referencing for Transient Absorption Experiments

This Python code implements a fitting procedure using a three-layer neural network to determine the optimal reference in a transient absorption experiment. The neural network learns the functional relationship between a reference spectrum and the signal spectrum. Originally designed for experiments with high-harmonic generation sources, it is versatile and applicable to various referencing tasks.
